This is is a fork of the GrazeRSS source repository for me to store articles on the external SD card of my Samsung Galaxy Fame.

To do this 

- Open the app directory as an android studio project
- Build/make module 'app'
- Generate signed apk

GrazeRSS is based on the NewsRob project, without which GrazeRSS would not exist. 

Use of the NewsRob logo and the NewsRob name is not permitted.
